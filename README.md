This project is a simple page modeled after Youtube, which is part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/embedding-images-and-video?ref=lnav) curriculum on HTML and CSS. 

It was a great learning opportunity because CSS is definitely an area I struggle with. In index.html, I did all of the styling except for the fontawesome icons and the toggle switch for autoplaying videos. This was all done without a CSS framework, and turned out quite ugly and unresponsive. The takeaway is that I got some great practice with CSS and a crash course in flexbox. 

I then rebuilt the project with Bootstrap 4, and while it isn't perfect - it took my only a couple hours and is MUCH more responsive in comparison to the vanilla css and html of the other file.
